course project
Download the zipped file and unzip it
read files I need into vectors
combine Train and Test data together one by one
assign the vectors proper names
combine subject and activity and features together
subset the whole dataset for those only containing "mean" and "standard deviation"
factorize the activity to descriptive variable names
Change names
use the plyr package to group the data with subject and activity
generate the new tidy data
